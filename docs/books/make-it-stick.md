## 1. Learning is misunderstook
* pilot landing story => shows importance of understanding

Some key points about learning:
* Learning is more deeper when its harder / effortful
* We are poor judges of when we are learning well
* Rereading text and massed practice are not very productive
* Retrieval practice (low stakes quizing/ flashcards) are more effective
* Space out practice/ interleve practice of two or more subjects
* Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning
* New learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge
* Distilling the underlying principles or rules that differentiate types of problems

Subchapters
* claims we make in this book
* Empirical evidence versus theory lore and intuition
* People misunderstand learning
* Early evidence (that repetition is poor for learning)
* Illusions of knowing
* Knowledge: not sufficient but necessary
* Testing: dipstick versus learning tool
* The Takeaway (wrong advice is being given)


## 2. To Learn, Retrieve
* Ebersold neurosurgeon, hunter story => shows how past experience can help in high stakes scenarios. Also importance of being qualified

Reflection is a form of practice
* retrieving knowledge from memory, connecting these to new experiencies and vizualizing and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently next time

The Testing effect
* Forgetting curve => we lose 70% percent fast, other 30% more slowly.
* A central challenge is to interupt the process of forgetting
* retrieval-practice effect -> far better than re exposure

Studying the testing effect in the lab
* taking tests reduces forgetting
* greater effort required by delayed recall solidifed the memory better
* schedule of testing matters

Studying the testing effect in the wild
* quizes after lessons resulted in better grades during exams (90% versus 70%)
* material reviewed in quizes but not quized did not show difference in grades (reviewing material is not enough)

Exploring nuances
* feddback strengthens retention than testing alone does
* delayed feedback yeild better long term learning than immediate feedback
* delayed feedback give practice thats spaed out in time

The Takeaway
* effortful retrieval makes for stronger learning and retention

## 3. Mix up your practice
* kids throwing beanbags at variable distance beat kids throwing bean bags at fixed distance for that same fixed distance.

The myth of massed practice
* examples of massed practice: bootcamps, cramming for exam, colleges that offer concentration in a single subject
* When practice is spaced interleaved and varied it requires more effort.
* Spaced practice is better than mass practice

Spaced practice
* Dura ble learing requires time for mental rehearsel and the other processes of consolidation
* Increased effort to retreive the learning after a little forgetting has the effect of retriggering consolidation

Interleaved practice
* practice of two or more subjects or skills at once
* clustered/concentrated learning on a set of problems may provide initial benefits but this falls of long term
* mixing the subjects results in low iniital benefits but better long term memory/consolidation
* learning from interleaved practice feels slower than massed practice. But research shows mastery and long-term retention are much better.

Varied practice
* varied practice improves ability to transfer learning from one situation and apply it successfully to another.

Developing discrimination skills 🤨
* Learning to differentiate between problem sets helps us in the real world
* commonalites between same problems learned during massed practice proved less useful compared to difference in varied practice when finding differences between problems

Improving complex mastery for medical students
* real life story about how med students need to know more than just what they are tested
* "Practice like you play and play how you practice"

These principles are broadly applicable
* American football coach Dooley (University of Georgia)
* 1) you have to keep practicing the fundamentals from time to time
* 2) you need to change it up in practice, because repetition is boring

The Takeaway
* massed practice bad
* beware of familiarity trap: the feeling you know something and no longer need to practice it
* interleaving good
* varied practice

## 4. Embrace difficulties
