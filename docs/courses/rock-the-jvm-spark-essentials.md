How to make the best of this course
* dedicated 1 or 2 hours of focus with breaks in
* course is challenging

Scala recap
* full notes here: https://github.com/rockthejvm/spark-essentials/blob/2.1-dataframes/src/main/scala/part1recap/ScalaRecap.scala
* key takeaways:
    * traits contain methods which can be given to a class
    * pattern matching is overpowered (lets you break down structure of input into switch statement)
    * futures exists, makes use of pattern matching
    * implicits do weird stuff. (compiler fills in arg for function when implicits around)
